# Animation Audit Playbook

The eight audit categories, what to look for in each, and the exact target values to cite in findings and plans. Distilled from Emil Kowalski's design engineering philosophy ([emilkowal.ski](https://emilkowal.ski/)). Never approximate a value that appears here — copy it.

These are defaults, not grounds to replace a coherent project motion language or an explicit user choice. Cite `file:line` evidence for findings. Accessibility takes precedence over cosmetic polish.

## 1. Purpose & frequency

Every animation must answer "why does this animate?" — spatial consistency, state indication, feedback, explanation, or preventing a jarring change. "It looks cool" on a frequently-seen element is not a purpose.

| Frequency | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| 100+ times/day (keyboard shortcuts, command palette toggle) | No animation. Ever. |
| Tens of times/day (hover effects, list navigation) | Remove or drastically reduce |
| Occasional (modals, drawers, toasts) | Standard animation |
| Rare / first-time (onboarding, feedback, celebrations) | Can add delight |

Hunt for: animations on keyboard-initiated actions, command palettes with open/close transitions (Raycast has none — correct), decorative motion on list items or hover states hit constantly. The strongest fix is often **delete the animation**.

## 2. Easing & duration

Decision order for easing:

- Entering or exiting → **`ease-out`** (starts fast, feels responsive)
- Moving / morphing on screen → **`ease-in-out`**
- Hover / color change → **`ease`**
- Constant motion (marquee, progress) → **`linear`**
- Default → **`ease-out`**

**Check `ease-in` on UI.** It starts slow, delaying the exact moment the user is watching. Flag it when the evidence shows that delay harms the interaction. Prefer the project's established curves. Where none exist, use strong custom curves as tokens:

```css
--ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);        /* strong ease-out for UI */
--ease-in-out: cubic-bezier(0.77, 0, 0.175, 1);    /* strong ease-in-out for on-screen movement */
--ease-drawer: cubic-bezier(0.32, 0.72, 0, 1);     /* iOS-like drawer curve */
```

Duration budgets default to **under 300ms for UI**. Longer UI motion needs a reason grounded in the interaction:

| Element | Duration |
| --- | --- |
| Button press feedback | 100–160ms |
| Tooltips, small popovers | 125–200ms |
| Dropdowns, selects | 150–250ms |
| Modals, drawers | 200–500ms |
| Marketing / explanatory | Can be longer |

Hunt for: `ease-in` anywhere, bare `ease`/`linear` on entrances, durations > 300ms on UI elements, tooltip delay + animation on every tooltip in a toolbar (after the first, they should be instant).

## 3. Physicality & origin

- **Never `scale(0)`** — nothing in the real world appears from nothing. Target: `scale(0.9–0.97)` + `opacity: 0`.
- **Popovers/dropdowns/tooltips scale from their trigger**, not center:
  ```css
  .popover { transform-origin: var(--transform-origin); } /* Base UI */
  ```
  **Modals are exempt** — they appear centered; `transform-origin: center` is correct there. Do not report it.
- **Press feedback**: `transform: scale(0.97)` on `:active` with `transition: transform 160ms ease-out`. Keep it subtle (0.95–0.98).

Hunt for: `scale(0)`, entrances that fail to explain a spatial relationship, `transform-origin: center` (or none) on trigger-anchored elements, pressable elements with no press feedback. A short opacity fade is a valid reduced-motion replacement and is not a finding for lacking a transform.

## 4. Interruptibility

CSS **transitions** retarget from the current state mid-animation; **keyframes** restart from zero. Anything triggered rapidly or reversible mid-motion (toasts stacking, toggles, drags, expand/collapse) must use transitions or springs.

- Entry without JS: `@starting-style` (legacy fallback: a `data-mounted` attribute set in `useEffect`).
- Gesture-driven motion should use springs — they carry velocity when interrupted.
- Spring configs, Apple-style (recommended): `{ type: "spring", duration: 0.5, bounce: 0.2 }`. Keep bounce subtle (0.1–0.3); reserve visible bounce for drag-to-dismiss and playful moments.
- **Asymmetric timing**: deliberate phases (press, hold, destructive confirm) animate slower; the system's response snaps. Symmetric timing on press-and-release is a finding.

Hunt for: `@keyframes` on toasts/toggles/rapidly-triggered UI, gesture handlers that tween with fixed-duration keyframes, drags without velocity-based dismissal (dismiss on `Math.abs(distance)/elapsedMs > ~0.11`, not distance thresholds alone), hard stops at drag boundaries instead of rising friction.

## 5. Performance

- **Prefer `transform` and `opacity`.** They can be composited without per-frame layout or paint. Some `filter` and `clip-path` animations can also be composited, depending on the browser and effect. GPU use is not guaranteed. `width`/`height`/`margin`/`padding`/`top`/`left` require main-thread layout or paint work.
- **`transition: all`** can animate unintended layout or paint properties. Name the properties that change and the resulting risk.
- **Check the installed Motion version.** `x`/`y`/`scale` shorthands may depend on main-thread work. A full transform string, `animate={{ transform: "translateX(100px)" }}`, can allow compositor execution. Do not infer dropped frames or GPU use from the prop alone.
- **Don't drive child transforms via a CSS variable on the parent** — it recalcs styles for all children. Set `transform` directly on the element.
- Composited CSS and WAAPI animations can keep running while the main thread is busy. Layout and paint animations still need main-thread work. Use CSS for predetermined motion, JS/springs for dynamic and gesture-driven motion.
- Keep transition-time `filter: blur()` under 20px — heavy blur is expensive, especially in Safari.

Hunt for: `transition: all`, animated layout properties, Framer Motion shorthand props on busy pages, `setProperty('--x', …)` driving child transforms, rAF loops doing what CSS could.

## 6. Accessibility

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .element { animation: fade 0.2s ease; } /* keep opacity/color, drop movement */
}
@media (hover: hover) and (pointer: fine) {
  .element:hover { transform: scale(1.05); } /* touch fires false hovers on tap */
}
```

Reduced motion means fewer and gentler animations, **not zero** — keep transitions that aid comprehension, remove position changes. In JS: `useReducedMotion()` and branch transform values.

Hunt for: movement with no `prefers-reduced-motion` handling, ungated `:hover` motion, reduced-motion implementations that nuke all feedback.

## 7. Cohesion & tokens

- Motion should match the product's personality — playful can be bouncier, a dashboard stays crisp. Mismatched personality across components is a finding.
- Curves and durations should live as shared tokens. Five hand-typed cubic-beziers that almost match is a consolidation finding.
- Everything-at-once group entrances where a **30–80ms stagger** belongs. Stagger is decorative — it must never block interaction.
- A jarring crossfade that shows two overlapping states can be masked with subtle `filter: blur(2px)` during the transition.

Hunt for: duplicated near-identical easings/durations, one bouncy component in a crisp app, list/grid entrances with no stagger, crossfades that visibly double-expose.

## 8. Missed opportunities

The additive category — places that don't animate but should:

- State changes that teleport (content swaps, layout jumps) where a brief transition would prevent a jarring change.
- Spatially-connected UI (a panel that appears from a trigger) with no motion explaining where it came from.
- Rare, high-emotion moments (first-run, success, celebration) rendered with none of the delight budget they're allowed.
- `translate` percentages (`translateY(100%)` = element's own height) and `clip-path: inset()` reveals as tools for these — no hardcoded pixel offsets.

Report at most a handful, grounded in actual UX seams you observed — not a wishlist.
